# Contributing to ManilaLiveRailFeed

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ManilaLiveRailFeed! 🇵🇭🚆

This project exists to make commuting in Manila easier and more predictable. Whether you are fixing a bug, improving the PID UI, updating station coordinates on the map, or simply proposing a new idea, your help is welcome.

## How Can You Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you notice the live map is inaccurate, the PID isn't updating, or the thing crashes, please submit an issue.
* **Check existing issues** to see if it has already been reported.
* **Open a new issue** and include:
    * A clear title and description.
    * Steps to reproduce the bug.
    * What browser/device you are using.
    * *Screenshots represent a huge help!*

### 2. Suggesting Features
* Open an issue with the tag **enhancement**.
* Explain why this feature would be useful to commuters or developers.

### 3. Improving Data Accuracy
Since this relies on transit data:
* If you notice a station is misplaced on the map.
* If the travel time estimates are consistently off.
* Please open an issue or submit a Pull Request correcting the data constants.

### 4. Code Contributions
If you want to get your hands dirty with the code:

1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes:
    * `git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature`
    * `git checkout -b fix/bug-fix-name`
3.  **Make your changes.** Try to keep your code clean and commented.
4.  **Test your changes.** Ensure the map renders correctly and the PID layout doesn't break.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a meaningful commit message.
6.  **Push the branch** to your fork.
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR).** Describe what you changed and link to any relevant issues.

## Style Guide

* **Code Style:** Please follow the existing formatting of the codebase (e.g., indentation, variable naming).
* **Commits:** Write clear, concise commit messages, use Copilot otherwise. (e.g., "Fix overlap on map markers" rather than "updates").

## Community

This is an open project meant to help the community. Please be kind, respectful, and patient with other contributors. We are all here to learn and build something cool for Manila commuters.
